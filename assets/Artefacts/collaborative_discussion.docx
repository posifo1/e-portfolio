The term "Industry 4.0" encompasses various technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics. These technologies focus on decentralising communication between people and machines (Schwab, Davis, & Nadella, 2018; Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019). Two examples of Industry 4.0 applications are smart homes (Hui, Sherratt, & Sánchez, 2017) and intelligent factories (Zhong, Xu, Klotz, & Newman, 2017; Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019).

The risks associated with 'Industry 4.0' can be categorised into several types: technical, competency, behavioural, data security, and financial risks (Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019). A technical risk linked to intelligent factories involves the necessity of acquiring various new capabilities and resources to implement these innovative solutions (Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019). Additionally, a competency-related risk arises from the lack of skilled human resources necessary to facilitate this innovative transformation (Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019).

Hecklau et al. (2016) support the argument made by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) regarding the necessity of a holistic approach to human resource management in the context of 'Industry 4.0.' They emphasise the importance of creating an environment in which businesses can acquire, maintain, and update the resources needed to adopt change and remain competitive.
